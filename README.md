# Mobile (React Native with Expo) DALL-E Image Gallery

I built a React Native Mobile app with [Expo](https://expo.dev/), where you can generate a DALL-E image with a voice prompt. The app implements a text-to-sound feature that allows you to listen to the prompts using voice. The app uses Microsoft Azure Identity for login in a React Native app. To allow the application to interact with the Microsoft server, it needs to be registered through Microsoft Application Registration Portal. The app data are saved into a SharePoint list.

To get started.
```
       Add a src/secret.ts file based on src/secret.example.ts file and add respective keys.
      
       Generate an Expo development build for development and a preview one for testing purposes.
      
```
